            "content_html": "<p>A while back, I shared my enthusiasm for <a href=\"https://getpublii.com/\"><strong>Publii</strong> </a>on <a href=\"https://kamuitubeda.com\">my personal blog</a>. For those unfamiliar, Publii is an innovative blogging platform that combines the power of a <strong>static website generator</strong> with the user-friendliness of WordPress.</p>\n<p>Static website generators are widely used by advanced tech users but often come with steep learning curves. Most require complex configurations and rely on markdown files (.md) for creating content. Unfortunately, these factors make them less accessible to the average user who’s more comfortable with rich-text editors like Microsoft Word, with its intuitive formatting icons.</p>\n<p>Enter Publii—a breath of fresh air in the static website world! Unlike traditional static site generators, Publii offers an easy-to-use desktop app that eliminates the need for command-line operations. It’s a perfect solution for anyone who wants the benefits of static websites without the technical headaches.</p>\n<h2>Advantages of Publii Over WordPress</h2>\n<p>By leveraging static website technology, Publii offers several advantages over database-driven platforms like WordPress:</p>\n<h3>1. <strong>Blazing Fast Performance</strong></h3>\n<p>Static websites are pre-built and don’t require server-side processing to display content. This eliminates delays caused by database queries or backend processes, ensuring pages load lightning fast.</p>\n<h3>2. <strong>Enhanced Security</strong></h3>\n<p>With no database to hack, static sites are inherently more secure. Risks like SQL injection and data breaches are significantly minimized.</p>\n<h3>3. <strong>Simplified Hosting and Storage</strong></h3>\n<p>Static sites consist of lightweight HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, requiring less storage space. Hosting is straightforward and cost-effective, with many free options available.</p>\n<h3>4. <strong>Scalability</strong></h3>\n<p>Static sites can easily handle high traffic loads when paired with a CDN (Content Delivery Network), without needing costly infrastructure adjustments.</p>\n<h3>5. <strong>Total Design and Content Control</strong></h3>\n<p>Static websites give you full control over every design and content aspect, ensuring consistency and flexibility when making updates.</p>\n<h3>6. <strong>Lower Costs</strong></h3>\n<p>Because static sites don’t rely on heavy server resources, hosting and maintenance costs are significantly reduced. Plus, free static hosting services are abundant.</p>\n<h2>Limitations of Publii Compared to WordPress</h2>\n<p>Despite its many benefits, static websites do have some drawbacks:</p>\n<h3>1. <strong>No Dynamic Content</strong></h3>\n<p>Static websites display the same content to all users, making personalization impossible.</p>\n<h3>2. <strong>Limited Interactivity</strong></h3>\n<p>They are less suited for interactive features like advanced forms, user accounts, or search functionality.</p>\n<h3>3. <strong>Content Updates Require Regeneration</strong></h3>\n<p>Updating content involves regenerating and republishing the entire site, which can be time-consuming for large websites.</p>\n<h3>4. <strong>Challenges in Managing Complex Content</strong></h3>\n<p>Static sites can be inefficient for managing diverse or frequently changing content, such as e-commerce catalogs or news platforms.</p>\n<h2>When Should You Use a Dynamic Website?</h2>\n<p>Dynamic websites are better suited for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Customizable Content:</strong> If your site needs to deliver tailored experiences based on user preferences or behavior.</li>\n<li><strong>High Interactivity:</strong> Features like login systems, complex forms, or commenting sections require dynamic capabilities.</li>\n<li><strong>Frequent Updates:</strong> Dynamic sites allow for easy content management without regenerating the entire site.</li>\n<li><strong>Rapid Growth:</strong> For sites with expanding content or traffic, dynamic systems handle scalability more effectively.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>The Case for Static Websites</h2>\n<p>If your website requires minimal interaction—like a blog or portfolio—a static site is the best choice. It’s secure, cost-efficient, and highly scalable. Even renowned sites like <strong>Smashing Magazine</strong> have embraced static web technology. After transitioning from WordPress to Hugo, they eventually adopted TinaCMS, another static site solution.</p>\n<p>For simple, secure, and high-performing websites, static technology like <a href=\"https://getpublii.com/\">Publii</a> is an excellent choice!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>",

Its seamless integration with other Google apps, especially Google Sheets, makes it a standout choice among form builders.<br><br>By default, each form you create links to just one Google Sheet. However, challenges arise when you need to share form responses with multiple people without granting access to the primary spreadsheet.<br><br>This situation is common in workplaces, where multiple divisions might need to access the same form but require separate spreadsheets. Sharing separate sheets ensures data accuracy and restricts access to sensitive information in the main spreadsheet.<br><br>If you’re looking to set up a form that distributes responses to multiple spreadsheets, here’s an enthusiastic, step-by-step guide:</p>\n<h2>1. Add the Script Editor</h2>\n<p>Click the three-dot menu in the top-right corner of your form, then select <strong>\"Script Editor\"</strong>.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://bloggertekno.com/media/posts/1/Tambahkan-Editor-Skrip.jpg\" alt=\"Editor Skrip Google Form\" width=\"1305\" height=\"664\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://bloggertekno.com/media/posts/1/responsive/Tambahkan-Editor-Skrip-xs.webp 300w ,https://bloggertekno.com/media/posts/1/responsive/Tambahkan-Editor-Skrip-sm.webp 480w ,https://bloggertekno.com/media/posts/1/responsive/Tambahkan-Editor-Skrip-md.webp 768w ,https://bloggertekno.com/media/posts/1/responsive/Tambahkan-Editor-Skrip-lg.webp 1024w ,https://bloggertekno.com/media/posts/1/responsive/Tambahkan-Editor-Skrip-xl.webp 1360w ,https://bloggertekno.com/media/posts/1/responsive/Tambahkan-Editor-Skrip-2xl.webp 1600w\"></figure>\n<h2>2. Insert the Following Code</h2>\n<p>Once the Script Editor opens, paste this code:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code>function onFormSubmit(e) {\n  const itemResponses = e.response.getItemResponses();\n  var responses = e.response.getItemResponses(); // Get the submitted responses\n  \n  // Construct an array of response values\n  var formResponse = responses.map(function(response) {\n    return response.getResponse();\n  });\n\n  // Get the timestamp of the form submission\n  var timestamp = e.response.getTimestamp();\n  \n  // Add timestamp to the beginning of the formResponse array\n  formResponse.unshift(timestamp);\n  \n  const pertanyaan_kedua = itemResponses[1].getResponse();\n  // var main_spreadsheet = SpreadsheetApp.openById('SPREADSHEETID');\n  // var main_sheet = main_spreadsheet.getActiveSheet();\n  var second_spreadsheet = SpreadsheetApp.openById('SPREADSHEETID');\n  var second_sheet = second_spreadsheet.getActiveSheet();\n\n  if (pertanyaan_kedua === 'Opsi 1') {\n    second_sheet.appendRow(formResponse);\n  }\n  // else {\n  //   main_sheet.appendRow(formResponse);\n  // }\n}</code></pre>\n<h2>Step 3: Create a New Spreadsheet and Share Access</h2>\n<p>Create a separate Google Spreadsheet and ensure the necessary team members have <strong>Editor</strong> access.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://bloggertekno.com/media/posts/1/Share-Spreadsheet.jpg\" alt=\"Berbagai Akses Spreadsheet\" width=\"571\" height=\"482\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://bloggertekno.com/media/posts/1/responsive/Share-Spreadsheet-xs.webp 300w ,https://bloggertekno.com/media/posts/1/responsive/Share-Spreadsheet-sm.webp 480w ,https://bloggertekno.com/media/posts/1/responsive/Share-Spreadsheet-md.webp 768w ,https://bloggertekno.com/media/posts/1/responsive/Share-Spreadsheet-lg.webp 1024w ,https://bloggertekno.com/media/posts/1/responsive/Share-Spreadsheet-xl.webp 1360w ,https://bloggertekno.com/media/posts/1/responsive/Share-Spreadsheet-2xl.webp 1600w\"></figure>\n<h2>Step 4: Update the Spreadsheet ID in the Code</h2>\n<p>To find your spreadsheet’s ID, open it and copy the part of the URL between <code>/d/</code> and <code>/edit</code>.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image align-center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://bloggertekno.com/media/posts/1/Mengambil-ID-Spreadsheet.jpg\" alt=\"Cara Identifikasi ID Spreadsheet\" width=\"907\" height=\"76\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://bloggertekno.com/media/posts/1/responsive/Mengambil-ID-Spreadsheet-xs.webp 300w ,https://bloggertekno.com/media/posts/1/responsive/Mengambil-ID-Spreadsheet-sm.webp 480w ,https://bloggertekno.com/media/posts/1/responsive/Mengambil-ID-Spreadsheet-md.webp 768w ,https://bloggertekno.com/media/posts/1/responsive/Mengambil-ID-Spreadsheet-lg.webp 1024w ,https://bloggertekno.com/media/posts/1/responsive/Mengambil-ID-Spreadsheet-xl.webp 1360w ,https://bloggertekno.com/media/posts/1/responsive/Mengambil-ID-Spreadsheet-2xl.webp 1600w\"></figure>\n<h2>Step 5: Set Up a Trigger</h2>\n<p>Next, configure a <strong>trigger</strong> to determine when the script will run. This step ensures your script executes every time a new form submission is received.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://bloggertekno.com/media/posts/1/Atur-Trigger.jpg\" alt=\"Mengatur Trigger Google Script\" width=\"424\" height=\"338\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://bloggertekno.com/media/posts/1/responsive/Atur-Trigger-xs.webp 300w ,https://bloggertekno.com/media/posts/1/responsive/Atur-Trigger-sm.webp 480w ,https://bloggertekno.com/media/posts/1/responsive/Atur-Trigger-md.webp 768w ,https://bloggertekno.com/media/posts/1/responsive/Atur-Trigger-lg.webp 1024w ,https://bloggertekno.com/media/posts/1/responsive/Atur-Trigger-xl.webp 1360w ,https://bloggertekno.com/media/posts/1/responsive/Atur-Trigger-2xl.webp 1600w\"></figure>\n<h2>Step 6: Adjust the Trigger Settings</h2>\n<p>Customize the trigger to match your needs, such as running the script on every form submission.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://bloggertekno.com/media/posts/1/Trigger-Form-on-Submit.jpg\" alt=\"Atur Trigger Google Form Script\" width=\"741\" height=\"612\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://bloggertekno.com/media/posts/1/responsive/Trigger-Form-on-Submit-xs.webp 300w ,https://bloggertekno.com/media/posts/1/responsive/Trigger-Form-on-Submit-sm.webp 480w ,https://bloggertekno.com/media/posts/1/responsive/Trigger-Form-on-Submit-md.webp 768w ,https://bloggertekno.com/media/posts/1/responsive/Trigger-Form-on-Submit-lg.webp 1024w ,https://bloggertekno.com/media/posts/1/responsive/Trigger-Form-on-Submit-xl.webp 1360w ,https://bloggertekno.com/media/posts/1/responsive/Trigger-Form-on-Submit-2xl.webp 1600w\"></figure>\n<h2>Step 7: Test the Setup</h2>\n<p>Now for the fun part—testing! Fill out and submit your form. Then, check the linked spreadsheets to confirm that the responses are correctly distributed.</p>\n<h3>That’s It!</h3>\n<p>And there you have it—a simple way to distribute Google Form responses to multiple spreadsheets. This setup is perfect for collaborative environments, ensuring data is shared efficiently while maintaining control over sensitive information.</p>\n<p><strong>Good luck, and happy form building!</strong></p>",
